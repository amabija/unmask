                  <h1 class="follow_text">The life of a passanger princess</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I had always been privileged growing up; due to the fact that my parents both had their own cars. They would pick me up to and fro school. I was what you call the modern day passenger princess for most of my life, the real deal cheese-girl as some would word it. I was seated in the back seat, strapped in as my parents would tune in to their ultimate favourite radio station, talk radio 702 – with John Robbie. My parents weren’t really talkers during drives, but I enjoyed the silence as I loved to gaze outside the window, and take in the very busy city life. </p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">The introduction to taxi life</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I was in high school, the first time my dad made me take taxis.<br><br>
I was in the 10th grade to be precise and the year was 2009, fortunately for me though I was already street smart, due to my holiday visitations to my grandmother’s place in Soweto. Life in the hood meant you would either be walking to your destination or catching a taxi. Uber and Bolt had also not been established yet by then.<br><br>
I would take the taxis just up the road from school; it was quite cheap back then, an amount of R5 for scholars would grant you a short trip from Fourways to Lonehill, the travel time was about 15minutes at most, if the taxis weren’t doing an interchange at Fourways mall, which was a bit time consuming and would delay the process of one getting home quicker. I would travel with my friends Sam and Kelly, who were a grade younger than I, and whom also resided in our neighbourhood Lonehill.
</p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">A friendship that had no bounds </h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">IThere was my best friend Tayla, whom also stayed up the road from my house in Lonehill I adore her. She was one of the few people in high school who taught me the significance and value of what true friendship is. I treasured that she was so giving of her kindness, and she reminded me of the very same quality within myself. Our friendship knew no colour, it knew no race, and we were just simple teenage girls navigating high school. On our birthdays we had this tradition where she would buy me gifts and I would return the favour. The first gift she bought me was an 8 ball (which if you shake it, it would it would give you some sort of inspirational universal message) It was such a cute gift and I loved it, on her birthday I got her an Issey Miyake perfume and she was happy, she loved it too. Our relationship was reciprocal, and it was giving. We bonded over being raised by our dads and the absences of our moms (although in her case her mom has passed) we were each other’s safe space, she would tell me really personal stuff about her and I would tell her stuff I was going through too. I was the shoulder she would cry on when she went through a break up, and I would act as the middleman between her and her boyfriend to help them patch things up. We’d do sleepovers, eat all the junk food that the tuck-shop had to offer during our lunch breaks, and she’d insist that I catch a ride home with her and her dad when they weren’t going somewhere which I appreciated, I have to admit though, it was much nicer going home in a Benz than it was in a taxi hey.<br><br>
 I will forever keep Tayla in my heart for who she was to me during my high school years.
</p>
