                  <p class="post_text">Bathabile Dube</p>



                  <h1 class="follow_text">The Authoritarian Dad</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I grew up in a blended family, which consisted of a stepmother, and biological father. My father had four children with my biological mother during their marriage and my stepsister was the one and only daughter to my stepmother.There were only four of us in the particular household I am referring to, my stepmother, stepsister, my dad and I, (my other siblings stayed with my biological mother and my gran). This was the time period in which I was just starting out high school, and fresh out of primary.</p>
                  <h1 class="follow_text">Blended family dynamics </h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I was raised mostly by my dad and grandmother. My stepmother was there, but she wasn’t really there if you know what I mean. My parents divorced when I was a toddler and my dad had sole custody. He was a stern, dictatorial and upright man who never minced his words, furthermore he loved the spaces he was in to be clean, and I mean compulsively clean. My dad could not sit thirty minutes without picking up the dustpan to clean the carpet, or dust the couches; or mop the floor; he did this religiously without fail. My father’s behaviour matched one of that who had symptoms of OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) although he was never formally diagnosed (this was probably due to the fact that he had never attended any form of therapy). As a teen girl, I was quite the opposite of my dad, honestly I wasn’t a fan of cleaning, I only did it because I had to and my dad would often impose it on me. It was so tedious, because whenever you cleaned with my dad, it meant you would clean the entire day and if ever there was a spot that you missed, you could trust my dad to call you out, - I’d have to come back and redo it, until it was squeaky clean. The excessiveness of it all felt a bit crazy for me.<br><br>  </p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">Describing the Authoritarian Parenting Style</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">Your father will never know what it’s like to be his child.<br><br>

					Life with my dad and stepmother was emotionally-taxing and abusive…
					<br><br>

					They were both extremely hard on me, more especially my dad, he had such high expectations. It was his way or the highway. I am the adult you are the child, I know everything – you know nothing! Shut up and do as you’re told! Keep your head down and don’t you dare talk back! If I dared to challenge my dad, even just a mere suggestion there stood harsh repercussions - like being lashed several times with a thick brown or black belt until my body would swell up with thick bumpy bruises from the impact. ‘I’ll beat you up Bathabile!’ - He would threaten and as a result I developed an extreme fear of my father - I was literally petrified of him. I was also frequently criticized – I was called names like stupid, dunderhead, fat, lazy, and on one particular incident when I had really ticked him off he went as far as to mention that I was ‘a mistake’. My stepmother witnessed all of this in complete silence, and on some occasions she was even the instigator. This is why I don’t neglect to mention, she was there, but she wasn’t really there, she was a mother but not my mother - she was more of a mother to her own daughter than she ever was to me. In such cases of abusive-authoritarian parenting any given mother who loves a child is supposed to stand up, protect and defend you, yet she did none of the above for me, moreover she condoned my  ill-treatment. She further knew I was fearful of my father and she used that a lot of the times to her advantage, that is to get me to do whatever it is that she wanted, e.g. making me wash over hundreds of dishes, ALONE - for an upcoming catering event that she had, or making me constantly pick up after her, or even running hundreds of errands for her, there was no rest (she had appointed me as her own personal handyman woman - I hated it there, and I hated all the stuff that she made me do – without any sort of compensation). It was like I was reliving Cinderella’s story. My parents were both emotionally unavailable for me and my emotions weren’t permitted to exist in that household, more especially the negative ones, which was insane! – walking around like a zombie, smiling at everything and everyone, and pretending everything is okay, when it really isn’t, all while you’re actually exploding within – was (for me) a crazy concept and an even crazier way to live, but I did it anyway, as that was the only way to ensure, my survival.
					<br><br></p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">Surviving the Authoritarian Parents</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">In order to survive the hostile environment, I had to adapt to becoming somebody else.
                  	<br><br>
					I learned to walk on eggshells.
					<br>
					I learned to speak only when spoken too.
					<br>
					I learned to always do as I was told.
					<br>
					I learned to silence my voice.
					<br>
					I learned to lie.
					<br>
					I learned to be an introvert.
					<br>
					I learned to reserve my thoughts.
					<br>
					I learned to hide my feelings.
					<br>
					I learned to be fearful.
					<br>
					I learned to be anxious.
					<br>
					I learned to be distant.
					<br>
					I learned to be pretentious.
					<br>
					I learned to be a follower.
					<br>
					I learned to be a doormat.
					<br>
					I learned to be an outsider.
					<br>
					I learned to agree with everything.
					<br>
					I learned to question nothing.
					<br><br>
					<br>

					All of these traits, I embodied. I perfected. I mastered.<br><br></p>


				 <h1 class="follow_text">Developing Multiple Personalities</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I further developed two separate personalities (the Bathabile at home, and the Bathabile at school) <br><br>
					At school I was encouraged to be the opposite of who I was at home, consequently I had adapted to a much safer environment.<br><br>
					I was confident.<br>
					I was interactive.<br>
					I was talkative. <br>
					I was in charge of my own choices.<br>
					I was outspoken.<br>
					I was inquisitive.<br>
					I was honest in my opinions.<br>
					I was an extrovert.<br>
					I was friendly.<br>
					I was heard.<br>
					I was popular.<br>
					I was collaborative.<br>
					I was elected best reader in the class.<br>
					I was selected to represent the school as a public speaker.<br><br>
					Where most children hated school, I embraced being at school, because it meant I was in a safe enough space to be myself, and it was also really nice to experience my body and my mind in more peaceful-calmed states. <br><br></p>


				 <h1 class="follow_text">How the Authoritarian Parenting Style affects children</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">The authoritarian parenting style affected my siblings and me in detrimental ways. Some became victim to drug abuse; others became physically abusive in their romantic relationships – and also toward me (I was strangled - almost to death on one particular occasion, my younger sister said the same thing happened to her), and with me, I became victim to alcohol abuse, moreover the physical abuse and emotional abuse didn’t end with my father, it seemed to follow me even in my (previous) romantic relationships. I was subject to physical fights and by permitting myself to become somebody’s punching bag - that had scored me - a shaming blue eye. It was extreme, but I too had a hand in it, because I allowed it, and I stayed in it, for the longest time. That battered and bruised little girl within, grew to be accepting of things she really should’ve been saying no to, and the blue eye scenario was first-hand evidence of this.  <br><br>
                  I also developed a strong sense of distaste and distrust in adults, more especially African adults. I projected my experience with my father and stepmother onto all African adults as I envisioned them to be uncaring, harsh and controlling, as oppose to my white superiors (e.g. teachers at school) who had a more approachable, compassionate and encouraging demeanour. I didn’t value being an African child, if anything I persistently wished that my skin was a different colour, when I’d notice the significant differences in how my white friends were raised, they were close to their parents, they were allowed to be themselves, and they were validated in their childhood experiences - which was everything that I lacked. My African friends had similar experiences to mine, like the neighbours by my grans house, their mom was like my dad, she was a single mom who was intensely strict and she would reprimand her kids by criticizing them and threatening to beat them up to a pulp with punches, hence I attributed rough childhoods solely with being black.</p>



				 <h1 class="follow_text">The Takeaway</h1>
				                   <p class="lorem_text">Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions you will ever make in your life, thus you need to have people in your corner that will assist to guide you on that path. <br><br>

				 					I truly wished that my stepsister could’ve been the voice of reason for me. I wished that she could’ve been the biggest advocate for my dreams and my number one cheer leader, unfortunately it didn’t happen that way and she was far from the person that I imagined her to be, she squashed a dream I was once vividly passionate about in a single conversation, that’s literally all it took.<br><br>

				 					I employ parents, elder siblings, guardians, even friends - when you engage in such crucial conversations with the people that you love, two very significant questions should run through your mind - first, is what I am about to say lifting this person up? Or second, is what I am about to say bringing this person down? Before you answer, consider these two very vital questions. If your intention is to bring them down, then you may just answer without any thought, but if your intention is to lift them up, then you should consider reflecting on what it is that you want to come of your mouth.<br><br>

				 					Being in a position of power or of senior ship is such a bountiful blessing and I cannot emphasize this enough because you’re literally in positions to lead people in the right directions, to point out their talents and strengths, you are in a position to influence, and encourage others, even if you don’t necessarily agree with whatever their dream may look like;  and even if it makes no sense to you, but I strongly believe it’s your duty as a person (above them or senior) to guide them on their path, and if you’re not going to guide, inspire, or influence them in a proper, positive manner, then you can just sit down and shut up, honestly.<br><br>

				 					Parents also should stop this thing of living their lives and their dreams through their children. Stop forcefully imposing your beliefs on who they should be and just allow them to be and find themselves, allow them to work out their own path, allow them to determine what they can’t go a day without, and allow them to live out their passions.  That is the true meaning of life – the ability to be able to LIVE IT OUT. What good would it profit you to have your life stripped away, by others living it through you?<br><br>
