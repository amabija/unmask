                  <p class="post_text">Bathabile Dube</p>



                  <h1 class="follow_text">What is racism?</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">Racism according to the Oxford dictionary is defined as: ‘Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.’</p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">Schools in the burbs</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I attended both primary and high school in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg and both schools were reputable. The way I remember it, it was a mixture of kids with different races and different backgrounds, whilst the vast majority of pupils were Caucasian and well-off. I distinctly remember as scholar’s afterschool how we’d sit at the gate and compare whose parent drove what car, this was our way to rank or distinguish, how rich one was (ha-ha). I find this hilarious now because of course you can’t attribute someone’s total wealth to a single car; I mean you could be driving a Toyota Tazz but live in a mansion or have millions of rands stashed somewhere in a trust - but at that age everything was at face value. As for me darling, my dad drove a Peugeot 407 so I was considered one of the elite, and trust little Bathabile to get a kick (at pick up time) from pressing the 0 in the 4-0-7 to open the boot and drop in my school bag (oh, and honey this was all done in slow motion like a kissing scene in a movie where they really want you to FOCUS and take in the moment). I’d hear my peers murmur ‘wow!  Did you see that? That’s sooooo cool!’ I’d do the celebrity smile and wave - goodbye - to my then, in that moment - little audience.  (No doubt about it I was quite spicy and rather melodramatic back then).<br>
                  I only recall having Caucasian teachers during my primary school days and I think there was one Indian lady, this was both in classes and aftercare, even my Zulu teacher was white, believe it or not! But she was brilliant, she had this short ginger-like hair and a skinny frame, our class always looked forward to Zulu because of her, she was so enthusiastic - she loved what she did and it resonated; and the energy in that class man, always left you on a natural high! She’d have us off our bums and on our feet singing Zulu numbers in her cute Caucasian accent shouting ‘Kunye! Kubili! Kuthatu! - Yisithupaaa! yisithupaaa! And she’d say Go! And we’d repeat after her, ah man! And there little Bathabile was mimicking my teacher and her cute accent. I speak for the entire class in saying; she was an amazing teacher who had perfected her craft and she was operating in the fullness of her gift - it was magnetic! It was beautiful, and she definitely left her mark on me. I can only hope the school gave her; her flowers.<br>
                  </p>

				<h1 class="follow_text">I must’ve been around ten years old, and in the 4th grade when I was first exposed to racism/cultural indifference…</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">My dad and stepmother worked long and late hours which meant I had to be enrolled in the primary school’s aftercare program (this was the time period when official school hours had ended - it was from round about 13:30pm-17:00pm). I truly enjoyed my time in aftercare; it was actually the fun-nest part of school for me, where we’d just let loose and relax outside of the everyday hustle and tussle in – class - learning. We’d play on the jungle gyms; dance with hula-hoops, there was even musical chairs and movie marathon Fridays (my favorite movie was Lion – King, and I was always amongst those who insisted we watch it every Friday when asked to choose from the lists of cartoon DVD’s. We’d watch the movies in the dungeon (a sort of underground dark room - the kind that you find abroad that people go and hide in when a natural disaster like a hurricane/tornado takes place. I loved that room; it was so cool and spooky. We’d play various games on the field, like cricket, soccer and touches. The one principle about aftercare is that if you had any homework; that had to be done first, before you could go and play – (which was good, it taught us how to prioritize the important things first, then the fun things later; which is a principle I still stand by.)<br>
                  At aftercare teachers would take turns in taking care of us, one day it would be this pair of teachers, the next it would another, (there were usually two of them on each day). One teacher particularly was my favorite; her name was Miss ‘K’ (for short) she was super friendly and a ball of fun to be around, what intrigued me about her was the way in which she would engage with us, we’d circle around her and to talk to her about anything and everything under the sun, we looked at her like another one of us and that was truly her superpower. Miss K was so laid back that she would even allow us to play with her silky soft blonde hair, and me being me I was absolutely fascinated. I would experiment so much with her hair - that which I couldn’t do with mine, I would throw it to the left and to the right, tie up buns, ponytails and plaits, I’d also put clips in very odd places, whatever I wanted to do on Miss K’s hair I did, and that experience was oddly satisfying, from that small experience I learned how to appreciate and value our differences – thank you Miss K - truly! I can only hope that like the Ginger-Zulu teacher you also received your flowers<br>
                  <br>
                  </p>

				<h1 class="follow_text">Let’s get down to business shall we?</h1>
				  <p class="lorem_text">Then on the other aftercare days there was the teacher whom I refer to as the ‘grump’ she was also a blonde petite lady, who always wore black motorbike like sunglasses, and her hair down, she had this grumpy demeanor and I don’t ever remember her smiling, (I actually concur she might’ve been in the wrong profession – because you can’t work with young kids and be that angry).<br>
				                  At aftercare we were always given food, usually a sandwich and an orange/guava juice. It was lunch time and we were all sitting outside in the veranda, the grump was sitting on a black plastic chair keeping watch as we ate, when suddenly she called out to one of the African girl’s: ‘Hey you!’ – She yelled while pointing, we all looked up at the African girl, ‘yes mam’? - She tried to mumble with the dry bread filling her cheeks, what are you doing? (We were all just as puzzled as the African girl). You-re mixing cement in your mouth aren’t you!  (The grump was referring to the act of chewing food while mixing it with a drink, this is done mostly among black folk when the texture of food is to dry to swallow alone and you need to yehlisa – which is to down your food simultaneously with a drink). The other scholars’ giggled at the antagonizing comment. The African girl didn’t respond but you could see the shame and feel the embarrassment in her face as she continued chewing her dry bread. I too as an African girl who eats’ that way, felt ashamed and embarrassed, I felt ostracized - I think we all did (as Africans). Up until that moment there had never been anything wrong with eating that way, my grandmother ate that way, my dad ate that way, my neighbors ate that way, and it wasn’t until then that the little me realized this was a racial connotation and a racist comment, targeted at the African race.<br>
                  </p>

                 <h1 class="follow_text">Another racial- injustice instance, but this time - directed at me</h1>
				    <p class="lorem_text">I remember quite well, I was in the 4th grade – confidence at its peak and sassiness at an all-time high. The school had organized an educational talk about personal hygiene, and the topic was Lice (parasites) let me specify and say head –lice. The talk was necessary to grant us understanding and knowledge. At the talk the speaker kept re-iterating ‘that much like a clean home head lice does not stay in dirty hair’ – it was like a weird compliment of sorts - to say if you have bugs in your hair then it means it’s clean - (yuck!)<br>
				                   After the talk each individual class would have their hair checked for these head-lice. We were divided into two lines, girls and boys. The teacher who did the checks for our class didn’t have a liking to me, and I knew it by the way she would eye me. As I was approaching the front of the line she was already eyeing me out, and I could smell the danger, I could pre-empt that I was about to be singled out…and I wasn’t wrong. My hair was braided and she looked at two lines only when she shouted ‘yes, you have both lice and the eggs!’ (haibooo mo-girl how!?) And a double threat at that! ‘The lice… AND the eggs!’ I couldn’t believe it, I almost cried - the mortification! The humiliation! - I will never forget. There were about five of us Africans and only two Caucasians diagnosed with head-lice. (Something was wrong with that ratio as research significantly suggests head-lice are more prominent in white people’s hair than it is in black people, so how did I end up here in the majority?)<br>
				                    Our parents were called immediately and we were sent home.<br>
				                    My stepmother got the shock of her life when she received the call, like I, she didn’t believe it to be true one bit, but we did visit the local chemist near our home in Fourways (as per the schools instruction) - to treat my so called ‘condition’. The pharmacist did her checks and to no surprise there was nothing there. So one was lying between the pharmacist and that teacher and I highly doubt it was the pharmacist.<br>
                  </p>

                   <h1 class="follow_text">So what’s the take away?</h1>
				      <p class="lorem_text">Racism/cultural indifference is a phenomena that is there, be it in schools, in workplaces or any social situation, it’s a phenomena that’s there, it may be hidden in jokes, connotations, suggestions, undertones etc. but it’s there and it’s prevalent, just not as blunt, I believe. For example the comment my aftercare teacher made to the African scholar, was a very intolerant comment, who was she to criticize and discriminate that child’s way of life? Who was she to ostracize and publicly humiliate her like that? And the girl really should’ve spoken up, I should’ve spoken up! (I speak for the vast majority) when I say as African children we are deeply conditioned into ‘respect your elders’ and ‘shut up and do as you’re told’ and ‘don’t you dare talk back’ and ‘you’re the child, I am the adult, I know everything and you know nothing’ and now when something drastic happens at school that’s wrongful and discriminatory, your shaking in your boots and can’t speak up. You sit there and take what you really shouldn’t be taking, all in the name of being a child, NO! That isn’t right, nor is it fair, and again, with the head-lice incident, nobody questioned or challenged why it was a majority of black students with head-lice and not the white, like research suggests, nobody cared enough to ask for a second opinion. Sometimes the problem isn’t at school it’s at home and in how we are raised.<br>
				      ...And just like that the racial oppressor has won, and the racial oppressor continues.<br>
				      I won’t at all discredit the school, and say it was a bad school, it was actually a very good school outside of the racial mishaps and just like in many other schools, there are good teachers and there are bad teachers, there are a good people and there are bad people. This is the 21st century though, when will the time come whereby we're fully accepting of another? A time when we fully embrace all the stuff that makes us different?<br>
				      The gist of the matter is though, those who are given the gift of authority over others shouldn’t mishandle that power, why not rather use it for the greater good? - That is to inspire, to motivate and to illuminate those who you have charge over.<br>
				      Dear leaders, teachers, parents, elders, please don’t take away from a child’s experience, rather be the one, to add to it.<br></p>
