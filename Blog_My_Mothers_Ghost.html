                  <h1 class="follow_text">What is the Mother Wound?</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I grew up in a blended family, which consisted of a stepmother, and biological father. My father had four children with my biological mother during their marriage and my stepsister was the one and only daughter to my stepmother.There were only four of us in the particular household I am referring to, my stepmother, stepsister, my dad and I, (my other siblings stayed with my biological mother and my gran). This was the time period in which I was just starting out high school, and fresh out of primary.</p>
                  <h1 class="follow_text">Blended family dynamics </h1>The Mother Wound as I would define it is the psychological damage that I have endured due to my mother’s absence - abandonment - neglect. (My mother is an alcoholic to put it plainly so it was always that over me. In defining the mother wound I would say it’s like going through life as a young girl, blindly trying to figure out what it is to be - a girl, woman, or wife. It’s both an emotional and physical void created by the very same person who birthed you. My mother was supposed to be my first friend and companion! She was supposed to be the first to choose me - once, sometimes, and always! She was supposed to be the first to love me and be my first love! She was supposed to teach me, care for me, inspire me, and be there for me! She was supposed to be something, someone, and anything! But the truth is, I can’t relate. The first woman I was supposed to look up to and hold in high regard is the same one that I barely even know.</p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">I am my father’s daughter</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">The effects of the mother wound have manifested in several different ways for me namely:<br>
                  Denial: The pretence that the pain didn’t exist and that her absence – abandonment - neglect didn’t really bother me (which was a complete lie to myself), how could it not? When everything surrounding me reeked of her absence. It was in the way (growing up) that I would watch my stepmother love on her one and only daughter so fiercely, so whole-heartedly that my own heart would bleed. I would hear through the grapevines that my stepmother would purchase for her daughter luxurious cars and houses, whereas there wasn’t a single thing I could pinpoint that my mother had done for me and that was a bitter pill to swallow. I’d listen in and watch a lot of the times when my stepmother would gentle parent her daughter and give her sound advice about life. All of this was an (excruciating) mirror of my mother’s ghost (absence).<br>
                  Self-hatred and self-blame. I hated myself for the longest time. I was overweight and messy. I looked at myself as ugly and un-worthy, furthermore I was in disarray emotionally, but I also hid it well, not many could tell and for the large part I blamed my mother’s absence on myself. I internalized everything concerning her and looked at her choices as if they were solely my own fault. The mirror was my most hated enemy and I had completely let go of my physical appearance, I was, what you refer to, as a careless being.<br>
                  Alcoholism and drugs (marijuana) I tried to numb the gushing blood of the mother wound by becoming just like my mother. I would drink the pain away and one bottle was never enough, it would call for another and another and another until I was so far gone. I tried cigarettes and weed (marijuana) as they were apparently good for relaxation, as a result I had lost a lot of weight and the effects of the alcohol were also visibly apparent, but I didn’t care, I was in a frenzy of numbness and I loved it. This way of life became my coping mechanism, every-single day.<br>
                  I further battled with making and sustaining friendships, (I still battle with friendships). My mother’s absence really dented my perception of people more especially females. My friends were mostly guys, and this is where the misconception came in, whereby I was seen as something else and labeled something else because of this special - friendship preference. My reservation when it comes to females in general or female friendships really stems from my mother’s ghost (absence), nothing in me trusts a female – put me in a room full of girlie girls and watch me become an introvert, - watch me suffocate, choke and die. I cannot, will not, won’t (at least not willingly initiate a friendship with a female) and it’s nothing really related to the idea that I am an ugly person or have no personality, it’s actually quite the contrary, those who know me, know I have heart. I just have a little bit of trust issues when it comes to the feminine – due to the persisting mommy issues I’ve had to endure.<br>
                  Without realizing it, you look for traces of your mother in other people. I looked for my mother in people that weren’t her. I looked for her in my stepmother; I looked for her in my partner’s mother, I looked for her in my relationships, and each time I didn’t find her something in me would break and I’d detach. I’d retract everything I once opened myself up to and close off. I’d keep it cordial with you but I’d never let you in again, well at least not on a personal, close level. I went looking for my mothers’ love in all of the wrong places, with a lot of the wrong people and a lot of the times that was to my detriment.<br>
                  Low self-esteem issues, I battled a lot with my self–esteem, although I was always a well – spoken child. I was outwardly confident and inwardly self–doubting. I think I was also particularly skilled at hiding that I had self-esteem issues but they were most certainly there. Somewhere along the line, I went from being a confident public speaker, to the one who always passes the baton when being elected to speak.<br>
                  Social Anxiety, I battled extensively with social interactions, the mere thought of being around people, more especially strangers was a nail-biting, daunting task. I believe this stemmed from my deep rooted fear of rejection; I’d always want to pull a pass, when it came to family gathering invites.<br>

				<h1 class="follow_text">I can share of a few tips that have helped me in my healing journey, these are:</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">Living with the mother wound hasn’t been easy and neither has it’s effects, but I believe certain things that happen to us, that pull us backward in this life, are also the very same things that propel us forward.<br>
                  Let me engage with you a little bit.<br>
                  I, now, being a mother to an amazing, gorgeous, brilliant and super naughty toddler girl; growing up without my mother has made me that much more present and involved in my daughter’s life. I am that much more invested in everything concerning her, extensively so, that I even research and implement appropriate parenting strategies. I literally follow and read on social media pages about responsive parenting, conscious parenting, parenting guidelines and tips, you name it! And of course there is no perfect formula to healing and parenting but for me the real take away is just that I want to give my daughter a full, healthy and wholesome childhood experience. I think motherhood is such a blessing of an experience for me, in that, the way I pour into my daughter somehow pours into me too, in the most satisfying, and fulfilling way. I being an extraordinary and involved mother has given my life its true sense of purpose and meaning, and seeing my little girl’s face full with smiles and laughter (each time we in the garden throwing the ball around or her laughing at a funny face I am pulling because of a dreadfully smelling diaper), this too is like therapy to the little girl within myself, and it’s both pure and powerful.<br>
                  There’s so much strength and comfort within myself knowing that the traumas I’ve once endured and the effects thereof will not be something I choose to pass down, and by God’s grace, the painful experiences I have been through are mine and they’re mine alone to navigate and heal from, as the love I have for my little girl forces me to be nothing other than an exceptional mother to her, and to give her a beautiful and whole-worthy childhood experience, despite not having that myself. In my eyes my daughter will always, in every moment be deserving of that.<br>
                  So, the saying is true that ‘the pain in families will always travel down until someone is ready to feel it’ - I was ready to feel it, thus we can either choose to carry the pain and allow it to be passed down or we can choose to feel the pain and heal from it, either way, the choice, is definitely, ours.<br>
                  With that said, it’s up to us to be more than great mothers! Involved and forever present mothers! They that are always striving to do better than that of their predecessors.<br><br>
