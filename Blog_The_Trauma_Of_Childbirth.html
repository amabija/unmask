                  <h1 class="follow_text"></h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">Many people speak and share on, how giving birth was one of the best experiences they have ever had, in all honestly I can’t say that I share the same sentiments.<br><br></p>
                  <h1 class="follow_text"> planned home birth gone wrong</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">My childbirth story is quite a gloomy one, I become sad and triggered just reflecting on it, in that everything that I imagined and planned for the birth of my baby didn’t quite play out the way that I wanted it too. Initially the plan was for me to give birth in a home birthing facility surrounded and guided by experienced mid-wives, with my partner also in the room. The setting included a spacious bedroom which had a bed and a water tub – for water birthing and relaxation purposes, which is exactly what I wanted. From the scary stories I had previously heard about the extensive pain a woman goes through during labour, I at least wanted my experience to be in more of a calming and relaxed setting. I had found this particular home birthing centre online (with no recommendations) and had begun my antenatal check-ups with them every three months during the pregnancy. One thing I found tedious about that particular centre was that they didn’t have all the necessary equipment at hand, which essentially meant I would have to travel from one place to another, in my state. In my short duration with them I travelled from Florida to Germiston for my Sonar’s and Soweto to Alberton for my 4d scans, they would also send me to their Doula in Saxonwold for other check-ups and when the mid-wives took my blood samples it was also tasked on me to go and drop them off at the lab, their disregard and lack of recognition for my state was the very first red flag. We were just fortunate that we had a vehicle but I mean what about a person who travelled by public transport? I don’t think that the midwives were very considerate people in this regard. I felt all that they did was take and test my pee, tell me to eat fruits and then collect my cash literally, while my partner and I did all the running around for them, I would’ve imagined everything to be at my ease but that was far from the case.<br><br>

Fast forward to the time leading closer to birth, the midwives refused to take me in despite that we had paid the full birthing costs which was a total of about R16000. They kept turning me away advising that the time had not yet come, despite that the contractions were there and extremely painful. Their reasoning behind that - was that they only book you into the facility once your contractions are at a specific time period, which for me was bizarre, when you’re in that amount of pain, trust me the last thing you’re doing is counting, and if you were counting you bound to lose count because wow. The other aspect was that the driving distance from home to the facility was about a thirty minute drive, which was quite far, should there have been an emergency, or the baby decided to come much quicker than expected then thirty minutes  was not going to work. I went into labour on the night of the 2nd of November and sat a total of 48hrs before my partner and I decided that it was best for me to then visit the nearest public hospital, as we had no idea what was happening and I was by then in excruciatingly unbearable pain. That wasn’t the plan, but I was no longer left with a choice, I needed to know what was happening and when I’d reached out to the midwives their only response was for me to keep breathing and that it wasn’t time, and that was just stressing me out  even more.<br><br> </p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">Describing Childbirth in a South African public hospital</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I had the most horrendous experience, giving birth in a public hospital.<br><br>

My partner Papi and I then headed to the nearest hospital in Soweto. Upon our arrival the nurses wouldn’t even let Papi through the door, which made me very uneasy because this meant I was clearly going to have this experience alone, and that wasn’t in the plan, he was supposed to be in the room and have that experience with me. As a first time mom, I was feeling all the emotions that come with pregnancy, I was uncertain, I was scared and I was also physically exhausted. I could’ve used a little emotional support but the public hospital denied me of that luxury. It was really difficult to say goodbye to Papi in that moment - not knowing what was coming next.<br><br>

Papi kept assuring me that I was going to be okay. The nurse then came to break up our little reassurance session, by persistently asking if I was coming in the ward or not. We hugged and he left for home. I headed to the reception with the nurse, whose face was very unwelcoming (like most of the nurses in that ward), she asked me for my file and when I explained that I don’t have a file as I was attending my antenatal check-ups with midwives in preparation for a natural water-birth at a home facility - all the nurses in that reception cubicle laughed their lungs out, I was the joke of the season, judging by their reaction, clearly they had never heard of such from their usual clientele, one of them even asked me to repeat what I had just said, and laughed even more at my explanation.<br><br>

The nurse then directed me to the cubicle which was closest to the reception area and I had the bed next to the window, she instructed for me in Zulu to climb on the bed and take off my panties, further advising ‘you don’t wear panties in the labour ward.’ I understood what she meant in terms of how underwear could cause an obstruction should there be an emergency delivery, but it was the way in which she said it that made me feel so violated – she sounded forceful, almost like she was shouting - she could’ve employed a better tone of voice for that particular instruction. She then put me on a drip, and placed what looked like a figure belt very tightly around my waist, with no explanation whatsoever about what was happening. Fortunately for me though I already knew what was happening (my sister and neighbourhood friends who also gave birth at public hospitals had already filled me in on the purpose of the belt) – they explained that it induces labour and they didn’t leave out the part about it being unbearably painful. I knew exactly what was happening and what was about to happen. The nurse left without a word. I was in the pits; it felt like someone was ripping my insides apart mercilessly – it was tremendously painful. A whole hour had passed without the nurse coming back to check on me, I needed a break and I needed water but the nurse was nowhere in sight, luckily I had a tap right in front of my bed. I took off the belt and felt like I was human again, I walked slowly toward the tap, and there was no cup in sight, the sink was also very dusty, I proceeded to drink the tap water using the hand that was free from the drip, I bent down and took three long gulps of cold water before I headed back to the bed. The nurse came thereafter and it was war when I explained why I took off the belt, she had no regard for the fact that I was dehydrated and in immense pain, and told me if I were to take off that belt again her and I were going to have a problem. Her attitude and the manner in which she spoke to me drove me up the wall, but I kept it cool and humble knowing that in my state, I was at her mercy. She came back to remove the belt 30 minutes later, and left again, no communication again whatsoever. The stomach cramps at this point were the absolute worst that they had ever been, which I figured was a signal that this was almost over, and I would soon be out of this firestorm,<br><br>

on that bed in those moments leading to the delivery I reflected on how alone I felt during the entire experience (apart from my partner and his mother), I had family – there was my mother, sister and brother whom all knew I was pregnant but I didn’t feel the physical and emotional support nor the love throughout the entire ordeal. My sister gave birth two years before me and during her ordeal she had my full support, along with my mother and brother, the time my sister was in hospital I spent every single day at my mother’s place, offering her emotional comfort while taking care of my sister’s duties in the house during her absence, I would also buy grocery items for the house and when she returned I was still there, helping her get off and on the bed, she even extended her gratitude by thanking me for showing up for her the way that I did. I did all of those things because that’s what family does, they show up for each other and they support each other no matter what. Sadly the presence, love and energy that I had given and shown toward my sister and mother (during my sister’s pregnancy) wasn’t reciprocated during my pregnancy, instead I had to lean on my partner and his mother for emotional and physical support and I will eternally be grateful and indebted that indeed they showed up for me and opened up their home to me.  <br><br>

It was minutes leading to the delivery of my baby; I felt all sorts of pressure, like I needed to pee, so I got up from the bed and preceded to the toilets, the nurses were all seated in the reception area, watching TV. I could hardly believe my eyes, so this is why they weren’t coming to check on us, it was because they were clearly consumed by the programme they were watching. I caught the attention of one particular nurse and she asked me where my mask was (this was the time period after covid-19 whereby we were still required to wear masks) she asked where my mask was and told me to turn back and fetch it (that time I was just a few centimetres from the toilet door!). Little did that nurse know it was such a struggle just to get off the bed and again that nurse’s total disregard for my state was appalling, I then slowly turned back to fetch my mask as instructed but the pressure became too much, thank the heavens that there was a doctor at the door of my cubicle whom I tried to rush to and asked her to check me as I felt it was now time for delivery, she agreed and came to my bedside, I told her how negligent and ignorant the nurse appointed to me was being and she advised that she knew all too well about that, she pointed to a monitor behind me and cared to share that for some reason those had been turned off but previously that’s what was used to call the nurses. She advised she would call the nurse on my behalf and left thereafter. I quickly called Papi and filled him in about everything that had happened leading to that point, he advised for me not to stress as he had set out to call management  regarding what was happening which we both thought was a good idea.<br><br>

Little did we know that we had only made things worse,<br><br>

It wasn’t long after Papi’s call that the nurse came rushing to my bedside, practically shouting at me for filling Papi in on what was happening in the hospital (he had caused a ruffle in their feathers) and they were now visibly angry. I was now in the delivery room and my water just had broken, when the matron had walked in, asking who was the girl who called her boyfriend, they all looked at me and I instantly became the elephant in the room, she also proceeded to grill me and advise on how selfish I am for wanting the nurses’ to be at my disposal when there were other women in the labour ward. She didn’t know that I had already caught them watching television and what she was saying was nothing short of an excuse. I didn’t respond, although I kept thinking this really wasn’t the time! I needed all of them including that matron to focus on the task at hand which was getting the baby out! She left thereafter and I was told to push by a very visibly irritated nurse, I pushed but nothing happened thereafter the nurse advised she was going to give me an episiotomy (the process of cutting my vagina open) she injected me with an anaesthetic so I didn’t feel thing, a few more pushes and my baby’s head popped out she told me to push again and her body followed, they immediately took the baby to be cleansed. I was then stitched, aggressively so, that tears began dripping from my eyes, the nurse was completely oblivious during that ordeal as she didn’t utter a word as she stitched. They then handed the baby to me and my heart was in that moment full, I knew that she was what it was all for. I was ushered to the post labour ward, but the pain I was in was unexplainable. I could barely walk and was shaking uncontrollably; I can’t even explain in words what I felt. During my exit the nurse was still mumbling complains about the call I had made to Papi, but I couldn’t hear her, I was absorbed and captivated by the pain I was in. My daughter is almost three and I still get severe cramps at the site where I had the episiotomy.<br><br>

I am grateful for the gift of life that is my daughter and for her I would do it all over again, but that doesn’t take away my fears and reservations surrounding pregnancy and public hospitals. I had such an emotionally and physically traumatising experience during my first pregnancy that it’s hard for me to even imagine a second pregnancy, I was emotionally alone and physically surrounded by very unkind people and that really tainted the entire ordeal for me, but other than that I love my daughter to the ends of the earth and I would lay my life down for at any given moment, I am most thankful and blessed that she chose me and Papi to be her parents, and she has enriched and given our life a true sense of purpose and meaning.<br><br>
