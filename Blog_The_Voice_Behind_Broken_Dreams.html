                  <h1 class="follow_text">The Blended Family</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I grew up in a blended family, which consisted of a stepmother, and biological father. My father had four children with my biological mother during their marriage and my stepsister was the one and only daughter to my stepmother.There were only four of us in the particular household I am referring to, my stepmother, stepsister, my dad and I, (my other siblings stayed with my biological mother and my gran). This was the time period in which I was just starting out high school, and fresh out of primary.</p>
                  <h1 class="follow_text">Blended family dynamics </h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I don’t know how to describe it in words the kind of relationship I had with my stepsister, maybe it’s safe to say we didn’t really have one, but just existed within a confined space. My stepsister was always out, doing something, with someone. I’d never really known her to be a home girl (although her mother always ensured that she had her own bedroom at home while also her own place to stay elsewhere). She would visit sporadically though and she had an admirable relationship with her mother. I think part of the reason my stepsister and I didn’t have much of a relationship was because, for the most part she was hardly around, and when she was around, she was mostly with a friend or boyfriend.<br><br>

					In terms of house chores, there was never a time when she had washed the dishes (with me or even by her-self), that was always on my dad and I, as a matter of fact she had never done anything domestic-related, and that was the first, evident difference between how the two of us were raised.<br><br>

					My stepsister was quite contrary (in behaviour) to her mother, whom was a staunch church member and councillor of GBC, I say this because my step-sister would come home at wee hours of the morning (I’d hear my stepmother open her bedroom door to go and unlock the main door for her daughter, they’d exchange a few whispers and from there two doors would close. My stepmother the next morning would force her daughter to come to church with us and it was always an unpleasant sight. You could see the anguish and unwillingness in my stepsisters face, but my stepmother wasn’t one you easily say ‘no’ to. I on the other hand was an every Sunday church girl, I love church and I love being in the presence of God, if you dragged me there with last night’s hangover, I wouldn’t fight you, maybe I’d try to reason to come back right after the service but I wouldn’t fight going there with you.<br><br>

					My stepsister and I were raised differently as I’ve already touched on; she was parented only by her mother, while I was parented by both her mother and my dad. She was always allowed to be herself and she was accepted and validated in that, if ever she did anything wrong that my stepmother didn’t really agree with, for example being dressed inappropriately, she’d gentle-parent her daughter to correction, and mind you my stepsister was always permitted to respond and disagree with the correction. It was quite the opposite when it came to me. I was more like – the black sheep, and my dad always did this thing (which I despised) whereby he would continuously compare me to my stepsister, constantly pitting me up against her, listing reasons as to why she was better than me, although my stepsister had her own dirty skeletons. She’d bring home (to meet the parents) various, different men, of different statures, some looked old, some looked chubby, others were skinny - and some were even married with kids, but the common denominator with all these men was that they drove expensive cars and were wealthy, very wealthy, richie, richie men, my stepsister was always about the ching-ching baby, it was either that or the freeway, there was no two ways about it. Although we were raised by the same people I’d never - not even once heard them, nor seen them call her names, emotionally or physically abuse her, nor even ill-treat her, that was reserved solely for me – the black sheep.<br><br>

					I think the one and only time I was ever seen and acknowledged in that house was the day that I graduated from varsity.  </p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">The Tea: About A Dream Killer</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">My stepsister had her own place; she lived alone, as she didn’t have any kids. The house was a cute, intimate double-story (I love double stories houses), in a smallish complex type of set up.<br><br>

					My stepsister had arranged for my step-cousin and I to do a (sleepover) visit, I think the visit was planned mostly for my step cousin as I’d never been invited to her place (solo) before or even after then, that was the first and last time I was ever invited for a visit (I wasn’t  at all surprised though , because as the black sheep in the family you discover very quickly that you aren’t exactly the family’s first preference, and you also won’t be treated as such).
					<br><br>

					It was in the morning, and my stepsister slept in, she woke up quite late that morning. I remember being particularly hungry (there was no food in her fridge) when she strolled down the stairs and sat us down around a square glass table for a ‘talk’ (-on empty stomachs at that). She sat opposite to my step-cousin and I, and proceeded to ask my step cousin first what her aspirations and dreams were (I smiled and thought to myself, this was going to be a really great conversation, as I was always one to be enthusiastic about my dreams). My step-cousin mentioned something about medicine or being a doctor and my step-sister validated her by saying ‘good choice, you must push and study hard’. She then turned her eyes in my direction and proceeded ‘and then wena what do you want to be?’ (She looked rather doubtful in regard to what I was about to say) I answered confidently and fervently: A Journalist! She smirked, and thereafter she unleashed judgmental sentences of hogwash. ‘So you want to be an ‘sshwashwi’?  (I don’t even know the correct spelling of the word as it was the first I’d heard of it. I later discovered it’s a Sotho word that means a gossip columnist). She went on to twaddle: ‘typical of you to want to be a gossip and write about the gossip of other people’s lives’. I gazed at her absolutely dumbfounded, and at a loss for words. She further shook her head in disgust, grabbed her car keys and told us it was time to leave -my step cousin and I then headed up the stairs to grab our bags.
					<br><br>

					I remember walking up those stairs, my eyes blurry and filled with tears.
					<br><br>

					I’ll never forget that day, and how she made me feel.
					<br><br>

					Again I was invalidated, disregarded, misunderstood, and unheard.
					<br><br>

					But it was her narrow-mindedness for me hey, and how quickly she jumped to that conclusion. Journalism is such a wide spectrum, so from where exactly did she gather the stupid assumption that gossiping about people’s lives is the kind of journalist I wanted to be? Moreover make that my entire career? Nxaa (clicks tongue) she honestly considered me and my dreams to be trivial. At that point in time not even I knew which type of journalism it is that I wanted to pursue, but the one thing I was certain of, is that I was a writer, a creative writer.
					<br><br>

					I was further away in thought from a gossip columnist, but on that precise day she totally threw me off Journalism, the sinister connotation she attached to it, and the manner in which she made me feel that day are what quenched and killed my dream. Even if it were so (for arguments sake) that I wanted to be a gossip columnist, nonetheless, it was her duty as a good elder sister to support me, or even guide me, but she knew nothing about being supportive, or building a young girl up and everything about being a critic and bashing me down.
					<br><br>

					And she didn’t stop there…</p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">Bashing someone down</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">After she had totally derailed me off of my journalism path, I decided to go with Psychology. I was so passionate about the concept of being able to help people, the diagnosing of certain traumas and mental disorders, and my personal favourite, being able to decide your own flexible working schedule as well as being your own boss. Being selfless has always been central to who I am, and what more, if you’re an individual contributing to a greater cause?  So pursuing Psychology seemed to be a perfect fit, and it ticked all the right boxes.<br><br>

					But not according to my step-sister.
					<br><br>

					I think it was Christmas day, a few years after the sleepover, and we were at home (my parent’s house). My stepsister had her friend over and the topic was about careers once again. They questioned me as to what it was that I was studying towards – Psychology I advised, and my step-sister was once again the first to shut me down, ‘ugh’ she responded, ‘imagine sitting all day and listening to people’s problems, and responding yes to everything and asking how does that make you feel,’ both she and her friend were going on and on about how depressing and mentally taxing a career in Psychology is. I honestly felt they were both projecting their own reservations about my chosen career onto me, and this time I wasn’t having it, I let them speak amongst themselves until they eventually changed topic.</p>


				 <h1 class="follow_text">The traits of a Psychologist</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I knew I possessed the mental capacity to handle a career in psychology, more especially because I was also one who had been through so much and what anybody else thought about the career, well that was their own opinion and they were entitled to it. <br><br>

					Psychologists are very compassionate people <br>

					Psychologists are very sensitive people <br>

					Psychologists are great communicators <br>

					Psychologists are amazing listeners  <br>

					Psychologists enjoy working with people <br>

					Psychologists are non-judgemental people <br>

					Psychologists are problem solving people <br>

					Psychologists are analytical people<br><br></p>


				 <h1 class="follow_text">The confusion that comes with choosing a career</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">After my matric year, I had a lot of people in my ear about which career path to follow. I randomly received calls from estranged uncles and aunts mentioning how a career in law was the way to go, and how much money I could make, bear in mind these people knew nothing about my strengths nor my passions, but it was more about imposing thoughts and when I would advise my stepmother of this, she would advise that I do not take that route as law was ‘the greatest career to produce liars’ according to her, so it was really just a lot of hearsay, and a lot of pulling and pushing in various directions. I decided to go with what I wanted and what I knew I loved.</p>



				 <h1 class="follow_text">The Takeaway</h1>
				                   <p class="lorem_text">Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions you will ever make in your life, thus you need to have people in your corner that will assist to guide you on that path. <br><br>

				 					I truly wished that my stepsister could’ve been the voice of reason for me. I wished that she could’ve been the biggest advocate for my dreams and my number one cheer leader, unfortunately it didn’t happen that way and she was far from the person that I imagined her to be, she squashed a dream I was once vividly passionate about in a single conversation, that’s literally all it took.<br><br>

				 					I employ parents, elder siblings, guardians, even friends - when you engage in such crucial conversations with the people that you love, two very significant questions should run through your mind - first, is what I am about to say lifting this person up? Or second, is what I am about to say bringing this person down? Before you answer, consider these two very vital questions. If your intention is to bring them down, then you may just answer without any thought, but if your intention is to lift them up, then you should consider reflecting on what it is that you want to come of your mouth.<br><br>

				 					Being in a position of power or of senior ship is such a bountiful blessing and I cannot emphasize this enough because you’re literally in positions to lead people in the right directions, to point out their talents and strengths, you are in a position to influence, and encourage others, even if you don’t necessarily agree with whatever their dream may look like;  and even if it makes no sense to you, but I strongly believe it’s your duty as a person (above them or senior) to guide them on their path, and if you’re not going to guide, inspire, or influence them in a proper, positive manner, then you can just sit down and shut up, honestly.<br><br>

				 					Parents also should stop this thing of living their lives and their dreams through their children. Stop forcefully imposing your beliefs on who they should be and just allow them to be and find themselves, allow them to work out their own path, allow them to determine what they can’t go a day without, and allow them to live out their passions.  That is the true meaning of life – the ability to be able to LIVE IT OUT. What good would it profit you to have your life stripped away, by others living it through you?<br><br>
