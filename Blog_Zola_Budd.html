                  <h1 class="follow_text">The life of a passanger princess</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I had always been privileged growing up; due to the fact that my parents both had their own cars. They would pick me up to and fro school. I was what you call the modern day passenger princess for most of my life, the real deal cheese-girl as some would word it. I was seated in the back seat, strapped in as my parents would tune in to their ultimate favourite radio station, talk radio 702 – with John Robbie. My parents weren’t really talkers during drives, but I enjoyed the silence as I loved to gaze outside the window, and take in the very busy city life. </p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">The introduction to taxi life</h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">I was in high school, the first time my dad made me take taxis.<br><br>
I was in the 10th grade to be precise and the year was 2009, fortunately for me though I was already street smart, due to my holiday visitations to my grandmother’s place in Soweto. Life in the hood meant you would either be walking to your destination or catching a taxi. Uber and Bolt had also not been established yet by then.<br><br>
I would take the taxis just up the road from school; it was quite cheap back then, an amount of R5 for scholars would grant you a short trip from Fourways to Lonehill, the travel time was about 15minutes at most, if the taxis weren’t doing an interchange at Fourways mall, which was a bit time consuming and would delay the process of one getting home quicker. I would travel with my friends Sam and Kelly, who were a grade younger than I, and whom also resided in our neighbourhood Lonehill.
</p>



				<h1 class="follow_text">A friendship that had no bounds </h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">IThere was my best friend Tayla, whom also stayed up the road from my house in Lonehill I adore her. She was one of the few people in high school who taught me the significance and value of what true friendship is. I treasured that she was so giving of her kindness, and she reminded me of the very same quality within myself. Our friendship knew no colour, it knew no race, and we were just simple teenage girls navigating high school. On our birthdays we had this tradition where she would buy me gifts and I would return the favour. The first gift she bought me was an 8 ball (which if you shake it, it would it would give you some sort of inspirational universal message) It was such a cute gift and I loved it, on her birthday I got her an Issey Miyake perfume and she was happy, she loved it too. Our relationship was reciprocal, and it was giving. We bonded over being raised by our dads and the absences of our moms (although in her case her mom has passed) we were each other’s safe space, she would tell me really personal stuff about her and I would tell her stuff I was going through too. I was the shoulder she would cry on when she went through a break up, and I would act as the middleman between her and her boyfriend to help them patch things up. We’d do sleepovers, eat all the junk food that the tuck-shop had to offer during our lunch breaks, and she’d insist that I catch a ride home with her and her dad when they weren’t going somewhere which I appreciated, I have to admit though, it was much nicer going home in a Benz than it was in a taxi hey.<br><br>
 I will forever keep Tayla in my heart for who she was to me during my high school years.<br><br>

				<h1 class="follow_text">The horrifying conditions of taxis in Johannesburg </h1>
                  <p class="lorem_text">The Toyota Siyaya aka the coffin on wheels aka the Zola Budd

The Zola Budd is defined as a really fast taxi or minibus, the name Zola Budd as per research states, is in fact derived from the actual athlete Zola Budd who was a well renowned long distance runner and who holds a 5000meters world record, thus translating the correlation between the athletes speed of lightning and coverage to that of the Toyota Siyaya Taxi and its mileage.<br><br>

The Toyota Siyaya taxis have been around for decades, and you can tell by their appalling conditions. Majority of the taxis I’ve been in and travelled with are deemed ‘not roadworthy’ but you’ll still find an abundance of them on the road. The taxis in Johannesburg are the absolute worst, especially the ones travelling to my workplace and coming back, honestly (we) taxi commuters risk our lives every single day just getting on those things, because I mean wow!<br><br>

I hope you don’t (lol) laugh out loud as I describe to you in detail, some of the terrible taxis I have experienced and have had to endure.<br><br>

In fact I would like to share with you an experience I had just last week.<br><br>

The taxi was of course a Toyota Siyaya. It looked like it had been through hell and back and it had survived and come back to shamelessly tell its life story. It was battered and bruised on the outside with all sorts of scratches, broken bulbs, dents and discolorations; the alignment of the whole vehicle was skew like it was leaning towards one side. The main windscreen was cracked with several other mini cracks - This was just the outside; and you don’t even want to get me started on the interior. The interior was crazy; man it was insane what was happening inside that taxi. Let’s start with the door handle, no scratch that, there was no door handle, instead the owner or the driver, or whoever repairs that vehicle had placed a short hard rope, which you had to pull in a certain direction to get the vehicle door to open. You couldn’t open the windows, as there were no nozzles, I tried to stick my fingers in the little wholes were the nozzles were supposed to be and push hard backward but that was an epic fail. The single seats toward the left side of the taxi were wobbly, like that of a rocking chair, except the motion was left to right and right to left, depending on which direction the taxi turned, you can trust that you and your wobbly chair would follow suit. It was worse when the driver was speeding because shame man, you would go from left to right and right to left very quickly, like a fast rolling pumpkin in the back of a lorry van. The driver’s seat was elevated and he looked at us through his rear-view mirror like we were his little subjects. The drivers steering wheel was an old looking - rusty metal skeleton, it had no covering, and the gear made constant strange noises as the driver would change. The taxi would reek of combustion and I swear I’d see fumes. Just as I am reflecting on what’s happening in the taxi one of the passengers from the back requests to get off after the robot (with me being seated next to the door I was automatically appointed deputy door keeper) Lord knows I pulled the rope hard toward my direction but that door just wouldn’t give in, the driver then starts shouting in deep Zulu no! Not like that! You must pull it up maarn! And there I was having a mini tug of war session with the door, and my colleague who was sitting on my right side instead of helping me, she was gasping for air with laughter as tears rolled down her cheeks. I grumbled about what a nonsense taxi that was to the driver.<br><br>

That was just one example; a few others I had travelled in were just as bad if not worse. <br><br> 

Among others, there was one particular Zola Budd in which was really and truly giving in, so much so that when we had to drive up a steep it would lose all of its power, engine and everything else would completely switch off and the taxi would find itself rolling back, the driver would have to hit the brakes and pull up the handbrake. The driver would give the taxi a few seconds to gather all of its little strength and retry but with no success, it would start and then switch off, start and then switch off again, you could just hear the defeat and powerlessness as the driver would  aim to restart. I and a few other commuters found this to be hilarious – I mean the excessive and forcefulness of it all made it even worse. It didn’t take much to spot the reasons why the taxi kept getting stuck and this was obviously due to the fact that it was timeworn; it even had large holes where our feet stood, you could literally see the street through the taxi. Commuters had to be weary not to drop their phones or coins or anything of that size for that matter, because otherwise you wouldn’t be able to pick it up, you’d find it gone with the wind. It was often time consuming and annoying, waiting for the next taxi to come, standing on the side of the road like poor, lost souls. The struggle was real.  <br><br>

Taxi drivers and their bad behaviour.<br><br>

If the conditions of the taxi you find yourself in aren’t bad, then you’ll most likely find that the driver’s attitude is, because in the taxi business, if it’s not one thing, it’s the other. Some of the drivers are so rude and vile; you’d swear that you weren’t a paying customer, deserving of just a tad bit of respect. I have seen drivers yell at commuters for not bringing change in the mornings (like it was their responsibility), or in instances where commuters would take too long to get off a taxi, honestly, the revolting comments that come out of some of these drivers mouths is shocking. Just yesterday I was headed to work in the morning and the taxi driver had the music on full blast, which for me felt a bit inconsiderate, - knowing fully well that you have commuters on board that need to tell you at which particular stop they are getting off - whom are now forced to strain their vocal chords by raising their voice above your extremely loud music, just so you can hear them was a crazy concept for me. I was incredibly aggravated that I had even got onto that taxi, because essentially I prefer my mornings (especially on the way to work) to be quiet, peaceful and meditational, as I believe this sets the tone for my entire day, and that driver stole that experience from me. I could barely hear myself think in that taxi, it was just too much noise, for that time of day.<br><br>

If taxi drivers are not shouting at you, or playing really loud music, or swearing at other drivers on the road, then you can find them flying through red robots, changing lanes without indicating, speeding in the yellow line when there is traffic and overtaking in all of the wrong places, and most of the time we as commuters don’t complain because I mean that’s what gets us to work on time right? We rarely reflect on the risk that’s actually taking place at that particular time. Taxi drivers, drive very recklessly and it’s scary; to think that every time you step into one of those dreadful vehicles - the fact that you could one day never make it out alive is actually a very real possibility, and the saddest part about it, is that these drivers constantly get away with endangering our lives. If I can tell you the amount of bribes I have witnessed just on a weekly basis you’d be shook, as matter of fact I don’t think I’ve ever been in a taxi where there was a lawful traffic cop who stopped a taxi and actually gave the driver a ticket, the drivers always grab a pink or brown note, head out of the vehicle, come back and just like that life goes on.<br><br>

And then we wonder why there is so many of these bad conditioned Zola Budds still operational on the roads, it’s because our justice system is failing us, and then tomorrow a breadwinner dies in a fatal ‘accident’ and that’s all it is, just another 'fatal accident', when in actual fact the problem is much deeper than that.
